Package.describe({
  summary: "Smart package for bigvideo.js. This plugin makes it easy to add fit-to-fill background video to websites. It can play silent ambient background video (or series of videos). Or use it as a player to show video playlist. BigVideo.js can also show big background images, which is nice to have for showing big background images for devices that donâ€™t have autoplay for ambient video."
